I study coastal ocean circulation using analytical and numerical tools (like [ROMS](https://www.myroms.org/) and [MPAS-O](https://mpas-dev.github.io/ocean/ocean.html)). I use these tools to study circulation dynamics in estuaries and the coastal ocean. I also apply these tools to issues in coastal ocean ecology, such as harmful algal blooms, eutrophication, and seasonal hypoxia.
