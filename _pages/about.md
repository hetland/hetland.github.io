I study estuarine and coastal ocean circulation using analytical and numerical tools, focusing on better understanding and prediction of processes in the coastal ocean that control the transport and mixing of fresh water.  I also apply these tools to coastal ocean ecology, particularly harmful algal blooms, eutrophication, and seasonal hypoxia.
